                    O my friend -- but it is too much for my strength -- I sink under the weight of the splendour of
                    these visions! A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet
                    mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in
                    this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine.
                </p>
                <p class="texto fonte-lucida">
                    I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I
                    neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet
                    I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour
                    around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees,
                    and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass
                    by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by
                    me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless
                    indescribable forms of the insects.
